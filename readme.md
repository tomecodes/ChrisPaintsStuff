<!-- git stuff
 git status
git add . / git add filename.html
git commit -m "your update message"
git push
Create & switch to a new branch:

git checkout -b branch-name
Switch between branches:

git checkout main        # to go to main
git checkout branch-name # to go to your feature branch
Merge a branch into main:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

git push origin main
Delete a merged branch:
